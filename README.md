# Plant-Disease-Detection-System-for-Sustainable-Agriculture
The lack of early disease detection worsens crop losses, contributes to environmental degradation, and creates financial instability, especially for farmers in developing regions. This situation underscores the urgent need for a modern, technology-based solution to ensure accurate, timely, and efficient disease detection, promoting sustainable agricultural practices.<br>
The main <i>objective</i> of this project is to develop a reliable and intelligent system capable of accurately detecting and classifying common plant diseases using machine learning and computer vision.<br>
### Technology used:
- Python
- Numpy and Pandas
- Scikit learn
- Pytorch or Tensorflow
- Streamlit<br>
